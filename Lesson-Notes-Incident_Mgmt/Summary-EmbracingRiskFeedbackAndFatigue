--Embracing Risk
Incidents will occur
Prepare and Plan for them (Before incident)
Practice response procedures (After incident)
Error Budgets
Change Velocity
Opportunity for improvement
Avoid heroics
On-call rotation 

--Failure of when, and not if
Complexity of system guarantees hardware failure
Cloud 
Security attacks
Organization may or may not know they have been attacked
Database corruption
Component update
Behave unexpectedly
Google: 70% of failures are due to component/configuration change

--On-call Rotation
Hard to provide 24/7 service availability
It is really required?
Is the support centralized or global?
How are hand-offs handled?
Heroics
Attraction of acclaim for saving the data
Set expectations
Burnout

--Alert Fatigue
Common when systems are at an edge point
Alerts have self-heal cycles
Monitoring cycles repeatedly alert the same issue
False positive alert
Often leads to ignored alerts
Will self-heal
Think it is not really an issue
Too many alerts

--Burnout
On-call rotation and alert fatigue lead to following symptoms
Missed deadlines
Behavioural changes
Chronic health issues
Obsession with problems
Self-doubt
Isolation

--Continuous Improvement
Automation
Manual tasks vs toil
Documentation
Reducing Toil
Update SLO
Update monitoring/SLI
Update alerts

--Automation
Manual tasks vs toil 
Automation is not automatic
Not all toil should be automated

--Documentation
Documentation needs to be kept updated
Postmortems
Engineered improvements
Better procedures
Corrections discovered during practice

--Reducing Toil
Tasks that are toil don’t provide a lot of value. Rather, they keep engineers from progressing with product and service development.
If teams spend the majority of their time on these tasks, they have less time for high-value work. This prohibits innovation.

--Benefits of Reducing Toil
Time freed up can be saved and reinvested.
Prevent future toil from emerging. In that sense, it’s a positive spiral.

--Update SLO
Important to consider when Service Level Objectives need to be adjusted
Might be up or down
Focus on business expectations
Customer satisfaction

--Update Monitoring/SLI
Better Service Level Indicators identified
More accurate alerting
Better warning of pending incidents

--Update Alerts
Eliminate false positives
Improve information that accompanies alert
Point to likely resources for faster fix
Assign some alerts to automate ticket generation
Focus on those that need immediate human intervention
